/// An object that allows you to create a light source in the scene, such as a sun or street lights.
/// Light types - Lights come in three flavors:
///
/// directional lights
/// point lights
/// spot lights
/// -Directional lights
/// Directional lights have a direction, but don't have a position.
/// All light rays are parallel and come from infinitely far away and from everywhere. Typically a directional light is used to simulate the sun.
/// Directional lights and spot lights are able to cast shadows.
/// To create a directional light use LightType.DIRECTIONAL or LightType.SUN, both are similar,
/// but the later also draws a sun's disk in the sky and its reflection on glossy objects.
/// -Point lights
/// Unlike directional lights, point lights have a position but emit light in all directions.
///The intensity of the light diminishes with the inverse square of the distance to the light.
/// -Spot lights
/// Spot lights are similar to point lights but the light they emit is limited to a cone defined by spotLightCone and the light's direction.
/// A spot light is therefore defined by a position, a direction and inner and outer cones.
/// The spot light's influence is limited to inside the outer cone. The inner cone defines the light's falloff attenuation.
/// A physically correct spot light is a little difficult to use because changing the outer angle of the cone changes the illumination levels,
/// as the same amount of light is spread over a changing volume.
/// The coupling of illumination and the outer cone means that an artist cannot tweak the influence cone of a spot light without also changing the perceived illumination.
/// It therefore makes sense to provide artists with a parameter to disable this coupling.
///
///Defaults to Directional light with  colorTemperature = 6_500.0, intensity = 100_000.0f,
